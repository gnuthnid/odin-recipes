    <p>A delicious New Mexican enchilada that we had every year for our Christmas Eve dinner. Serve 2 to 3 enchiladas on
        a plate and surround with lettuce and tomatoes. Top with your choice of guacamole or sour cream or both.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>12 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies, drained</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Combine the chicken, sour
            cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dip the corn tortillas into the hot oil one at a time until
            softened, about 10 seconds each. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of chicken mixture onto each tortilla, spread
            down the center and roll into a cylinder. Place seam side down into the prepared baking dish. When all
            tortillas are filled and rolled, sprinkle the green chiles over all and top with the shredded Monterey Jack
            cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the enchiladas are hot, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
